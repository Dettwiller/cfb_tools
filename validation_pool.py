    TODO: Tune the model
        1. set up optimization
        2. maximize % correct winners?
        3. maximize probability of correct winner
        4. minimize standard deviation of predicted scores
        5. drive differential and total probabilities to 0.5 (accuracy)
        6. multiobjective of 5 and 4
