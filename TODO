write unit tests for functions
only import necessary parts of os or os.path
only import necessary parts of csv in utility
optimize individual functions for speed
check out the runtime warnings and see what can be done
add input checking to all functions
    abuse the try and except to make sure diagnostic info is printed when inputs aren't correct
There is a significant error hurting the analysis somewhere
    run model_example.py for an example
